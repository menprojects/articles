## Install Ansible

Please read:

- [Ansible Overview and Architecture](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/overview_architecture.html)
- [Installing Ansible on Specific Operating Systems](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-specific-operating-systems)

### Install

```shell
apt update
apt install software-properties-common
add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
apt install ansible

cd /root

# make an SSH key and make it so we can log in as root to localhost.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" 127.0.0.1 echo "done"
```


# Initial Self Test

```shell
cd /etc/ansible

touch /etc/ansible/hosts
echo "[self]"    >> hosts
echo "127.0.0.1" >> hosts

echo "" >> hosts
echo "[self:vars]
ansible_connection=ssh
   " >> hosts

mv -f ansible.cfg ansible.cfg_initial

echo "[defaults]
inventory = hosts
host_key_checking = False
        " >> ansible.cfg
```
#Verify the initial "self" commands:

```shell
ansible -m ping self               # using the ping module
ansible self -a "echo 'hello'"    # and ad-hoc command
ansible self -a "date"            # get date
ansible self -a "uptime"          # Get the uptime for this server
```

# Initial Playbook

```shell
cd /etc/ansible
mkdir -p playbooks

echo "
- hosts: all

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure a list of packages installed
      apt:
        name: htop
        state: present
" >> playbooks/test-package.yml
```

# Now run the playbook:

```shell
ansible-playbook -i "127.0.0.1," playbooks/test-package.yml
```

# Re-test the playbook:
```shell
apt-get -y remove htop
# Make sure it doesn't exist
htop

# Then rerun the playbook
ansible-playbook -i "127.0.0.1," playbooks/test-package.yml

# Then see if it exists
htop
```

# Configure the control server
* Edit /etc/ansible/hosts
    * Add host -- change the ip address to the ip address of your target server. 
        * example
```text

   # If you are NOT the user ansible on the control server. 
[all:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=ansible

[testservers]
 192.168.1.7 # Make sure to change this to the ip address of your server. 

  # Example of changing variables for group testservers.
  # This does not change anything since the default is ssh anyways.

[testservers:vars]
ansible_connection=ssh

```
    * Also, remove "[self]"  and "[self:vars]" sections. 

# Configure the other computer
* Add ansible user
  * Login as root or sudo on TARGET server
      * If sudo: sudo bash
  * Add user anisble
      * useradd -m -s /bin/bash ansible
      * passwd ansible
         * Remember the password
* Edit /etc/sudoers.d/ansible and add
      * ansible     ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
* Login in as ansible from root
      * su -u ansible
      * Create ssh key on TARGET server
         * ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
	 * This setupts up the .ssh directory, and we might use the ssh from the target server later. 


# Configure ssh login from control server to target server. 

* Copy the .ssh/id_rsa.pub key from the control server to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of target server
      * Verfiy your host list on source computer. You should only have one server. You should have removed "[self] from hosts file.
          * ansible all --list-hosts
      * EX: From the source computer
           * scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ansible@192.168.1.7:.ssh/authorized_keys
	   * Entering a password is okay. 
      * On the control server, ssh to target server and see if everything works
           * ssh ansible@192.168.1.7 'echo "ssh works"'
           * If you don't get the response back "ssh works" without having to type in a password, nothing later in this article will work.
      * This should also work : ansible all -m ping

# Test commands on the control server to the target server.
The default module for ad hoc commands is
[ansible.builtin.command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/command_module.html#command-module). We will be excuting commands
using "-a". If no module is specified, this module is used.

* These commands should work
    * ansible all -a "hostname "
    * ansible all -a "ls -al "
    * ansible all -a "date "
    * ansible all -m command -a hostname 
    * ansible all -m shell -a uptime 

But multiple commands will FAIL
    * ansible all -a "hostname ; date  "

To issue mutiple commands, use "shell"
    * ansible all -m  shell -a "ls -la ; echo 'my hostname is '; hostname

This response should say "ansible".
    *  ansible   all  -a "whoami"
The response to this sould be "root".
    * ansible --become   all  -a "whoami"

# Gotchas
    * Single or double quote
      Notice this command fails using the get_url module.
        * ansible all   -m get_url -a "url=http://google.com dest=~/a.html"
      But this works.
        * ansible all   -m get_url -a 'url=http://google.com dest=~/a.html'
      Double quotes doesn't work for this command, but single quotes do.

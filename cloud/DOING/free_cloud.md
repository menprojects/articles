* (AWS)[https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=tier%23always-free&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all]
   * Limits by usage  -- up 100%
       * database : redshift, Dynamo, SimpleDB
       * Monitoring -- cloudwatch, GLue, Key management
       * Programming -- lambda
       * Infrasturcture -- CLoudFront, Route

   * No longer
      * EC2 -- now if you make a 3 year contract, you pay per month for your ip address. GCP per month at the lowest costs is about $4 per month.
      I am paying over $10 a month with a 3 year contract. Its better to just stop using AWS and use GCP. You recupe your costs quickly. 
   * There are other free services, but I am not interested in them right now. 


* [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/free)
   * Storage
       * Cloud storage ; 5GB and traffic -- enough for testing
       * database
          * Big Query, pub/sub, firestore
       * Programming -- secret manager

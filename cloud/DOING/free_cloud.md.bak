<a name=s></a>Summary
-----

These services are free until you go beyond a resource limit. I don't list all the services, just the ones I am interested in. 


* * *
<a name=g></a>GCP
-----

* [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/free)
   * Storage
       * Cloud storage ; 5GB and traffic -- enough for testing
       * database
          * Big Query, pub/sub, firestore
       * Programming -- secret manager


* * *
<a name=a></a>AWS
-----

* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=tier%23always-free&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all)
   * Limits by usage  -- up 100%
       * database : redshift, Dynamo, SimpleDB
       * Monitoring -- cloudwatch, GLue, Key management
       * Programming -- lambda
       * Infrasturcture -- CLoudFront, Route

   * No longer
      * EC2 -- now if you make a 3 year contract, you pay per month for your ip address. GCP per month at the lowest costs is about $4 per month.
      I am paying over $10 a month with a 3 year contract. Its better to just stop using AWS and use GCP. You recipe your costs quickly.
   * There are other free services, but I am not interested in them right now.

MongoDB is not always free on the cloud.

But you can get free monitoring : https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.0/administration/free-monitoring/

* * *
<a name=c></a>CockroachDB
-----

Free : https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/

* Make sure you use GCP --- I believe AWS charges for traffic. Be careful what region you chose in GCP. Check the charts.

* https://newrelic.com/pricing/free-tier

Free monitoring. Be careful how often you alert and load data. You have 100 GB free a month.Reduce the checking of your servers.

Edit monitors:
* https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors/
* In accounts: go to Synthetic Monitoring
    * edit /etc/newrelic-infra.yml
    * Use the template at https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/blob/master/assets/examples/infrastructure/newrelic-infra-template.yml.example
    * wget -O /etc/newrelic-infra.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/master/assets/examples/infrastructure/newrelic-infra-template.yml.example
* Commands
    * Start/Stop : https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/
    * sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra

NOTE: I could not change the metric settings in the yml file because it would not accept the license key. Then when I removed the yml file, it still would not restart.
I think the license key is stored temporarily somewhere and when you make your yml file is deletes the previous config and then won't work again. You have to remove
and install again. 


```
 # Put in your license key first. 

 ### add this to config file for once an hour -- for testng purposes. 

metrics_network_sample_rate: 3600
metrics_process_sample_rate: 3600
metrics_storage_sample_rate: 3600
metrics_system_sample_rate: 3600

### restart
sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra
sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra

```

-----
You can sign up with the same email every 30 days. It means, you can make it always free, but you have to sign up again.

I recommend using the $2 option per month and limiting the amount of data and traffic after the free month.

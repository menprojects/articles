Add difference between lock wait timeout and deadlock, lock wait timeout happens immediately, and times out oe deadlocks
after lock wait timeout is exceeded.
Add shared and exclusixe lock to locks article adn explain how locks work. 
Add in explain analyze problem explanation. 
DONE Check if I made a document combining show processlist, and in performance meta_locks and threads to explain locks. 51. 

Add intention_exclusive, and other things to lock article. IS and IX are for innodb, I and X are for table locks
LOCK_TYPE: The lock type from the metadata lock subsystem. The value is one of INTENTION_EXCLUSIVE, SHARED, SHARED_HIGH_PRIO, SHARED_READ, SHARED_WRITE, SHARED_UPGRADABLE, SHARED_NO_WRITE, SHARED_NO_READ_WRITE, or EXCLUSIVE
Explain : I and X are row level. IS and IX are table with row specific. IS and IX have to happen first before S and X are granted.

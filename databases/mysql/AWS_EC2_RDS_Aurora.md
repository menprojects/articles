* EC2
    * You install and maintain your own system. It is like a computer in your own data center. You have many operating systems to choose from. 
    * Backups, monitoring, etc are all on you.
    * You don't have to upgrade MySQL if you don't want to. You can put any version on it.

* RDS MySQL
    * It is a MySQL service.
    * Its has Cloudwatch monitoring.
    * There is DMS to migrate MySQL to RDS MySQL.
    * Supports versions 5.7 and 8.0.
       * [Recent supported versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.html#MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.Supported)
    * Backups are automatic.
    * Resizing is allowed.
    * Adding Read Replicas is easy.
    * Point in time recovery (time travel).
    * Caching, like memcache or ElasticCache is available.
    * [Features not supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Concepts.FeatureSupport.html#MySQL.Concepts.Features)
    * [Limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.KnownIssuesAndLimitations.html)
    * Automatic failover is available.
        * 60 to 120 seconds
    * Replication to Read Replica is done by normal MySQL replication.
    * Storage auto scaling available vertically.


* Aurora
    * It is a MySQL service.
    * Its has Cloudwatch monitoring.
    * There is DMS to migrate MySQL to RDS MySQL.
    * Supports versions 5.7 and 8.0.
    * Backups are automatic.
    * Resizing is allowed.
    * Adding Read Replicas is easy.
    * Caching, like memcache or ElasticCache is available.
    * Features not supported [5.7](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.CompareMySQL57.html]
    and [8.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.MySQL80.html)
    * Automatic failover is available
        * 60 seconds, even 30 seconds.
    * Aurora has auto scaling vertically and horizontally.

* RDS has that Aurora doesn't
    * NEW: In November 2023, RDS has group replication with version 8.0.35 and higher. This makes failover faster than aurora.     * It can use more storage engines.  

* Aurora has that RSA MySQL doesn't
    * Replication is done differently. Instead of normal MySQL replication [Aurora has faster replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html) because the read replicas are physical copies or primary. [Cluster Volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.StorageReliability.html#Aurora.Overview.Storage)
    * Supposedly x5 faster than MySQL, but heavy write loads may not see the benefit. 
    * Aurora Serverless is available.
        * An on demand database.
        * Version 1 and 2
    * Parallel queries are available. Queries are divided among all the servers.
    * Data is copied to 3 Availability Zones, with each Availability Zone persisting 2 copies of each write.
    * Backtrack for Aurora MySQL -- time travel. Lets you go back to a previous state in time of the database.
    * Encryption at rest is available. Affects Backups and snapshots.
    * Aurora has auto scaling read replicas. It will spin up read replicas if needed automatically.
    * Aurora is also PostgreSQL compatible.
    * Can have upto 15 read replicas, while RDS MySQL can have 5.
    * Built For High Availability. Multiple copies in different Availability zones makes it HA along with automatic failover. 
    * Except for Group replication, failover in Aurora in faster than RDS.
* Future topics
  * cost
  * Aurora Serverless versus Aurora
  * more performance

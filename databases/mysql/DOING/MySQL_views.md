MySQL Fix Views
==============================

_**by Mark Nielsen

Some views may not work. This technique could be used for other things like corrupt tables, stored prcoedures, etc. 

1. [Links](#links)


* * *
<a name=links></a>Links
-----

* * *
<a name=Setup></a>Setup 
-----


```
* * *
<a name=linux></a>Figure out if objects are executable.
-----

Even though they are executable, it doesn't mean they are correct. Views and stored procedures could be made badly.
